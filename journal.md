Bunch of PCB progress. Layed out. Just need part sourcing and routing.

PCB routing is done. Some ammount of part sourcing is done. Need to finish sourcing the rest of the parts.

Added Boost converter to the PCB. For 5v rail on battery.

All fits nicely in the same size of the PCB.

BOM and lots of minor fixes. I decided to go with a BetaFPV battery and a cable instead of a JST connector.
