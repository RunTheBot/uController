Bunch of PCB progress. Layed out. Just need part sourcing and routing.

PCB routing is done. Some ammount of part sourcing is done. Need to finish sourcing the rest of the parts.

All fits nicely in the same size of the PCB.

BOM and lots of minor fixes. I decided to go with a BetaFPV battery and a cable instead of a JST connector.

Soldered the entire thing. I kinda broke the Nano s3 by overheating it sooooooo. I need to bodge wire a xiao in. I should have used it to start.

Dodge wired it. Turns out one hall effect sensor doesn't work. Otherwise, it's completely working. I'm about to travel so demo time!
